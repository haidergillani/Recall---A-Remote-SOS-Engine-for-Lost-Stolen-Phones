Founder  
Full Stack Developer "Recall" App  
When my phone got pickpocketed, I faced the inefficiencies in Google's Find My Device software, such as requiring active internet, GPS, and access to trusted devices. With 70 million+ phones lost/stolen annually, I identified the necessity of a convenient yet effective solution for people to find their phones.  
I took the initiative to fill this gap by building “Recall,” a remote SOS engine that could help find a phone soon after it is lost or stolen. I developed the front and back end of my app and its web-based desktop version using Flutter SDK for Android and iOS.  
"Recall" triggers remote SOS via text code, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or always active GPS. It sends real-time location to the source phone, sounds an alarm, and automatically attends the next call to the lost phone on speaker. Recall solves the common problem of losing phones and helps the 70 million+ people affected by this issue worldwide. A convenient solution for anyone, anywhere.
